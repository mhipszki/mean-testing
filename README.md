#Testing throughout the MEAN stack

This project is intended to show the concept of adding a new Feature to a MEAN stack application by first turning a User Story with Acceptance Criteria to tests and then gradually add production code fulfilling test cases.

This way we can make sure we have proper requirements (it will turn out if we don't) and that those requirements are completely fulfilled by running our automated test suites anytime.
